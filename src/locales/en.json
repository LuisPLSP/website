    "title": "About Us",
    "text": "The whole idea was born during Luis’ Erasmus semester in Germany. Being deprived of riding dirt bikes, he realized how important the sport was to him. At that time, he was also watching a lot of YouTube videos, which made him realize that there was not much content specifically for the Offroad community. That was how Steps to Podium was born. In a funny, simple, and straightforward way, without any kind of interest or endorsement, Steps to Podium wants to inspire, teach and help amateur riders from around the globe."

  "testimonial2": "It was fantastic. It was great to understand what the bike can and cannot do, how I can improve my times in the races, and to lose the fear of messing with the clicks.",
  "testimonialperson2": "Hugo Teixeira",
  "testimonial3": "I think the two courses complement each other very well, and I would say that it is almost mandatory to do both, because it really makes a difference.",
  "testimonialperson3": "Filipe Regalado Sousa",
  "testimonial4": "I found this course very productive. It allows us to explore a lot of the click tunings and I think it's very important that we can do that. We can really feel all the sensations on top of the dirt bike.",
  "testimonialperson4": "Luís Silva",
  "testimonial5": "The atmosphere is very good. The fact that you have riders with different experiences sharing knowledge and discussing concepts that will later be experienced in practice is super interesting. It's not just content that can be read anywhere, it's truly feeling and understanding how things work.",
  "testimonialperson5": "Pedro Peixoto",
  "testimonial6": "This is great. All people should know what compression and rebound means, or what is high or low speed... and the influence of these adjustments when riding, in terms of comfort [for the rider].",
  "testimonialperson6": "Hugo Mota",
  "testimonial7": "This is very good for people to be comfortable in experimenting and understand how a suspension or shock absorber works. Hearing the explanation of what each tuning does and then realizing what it conveys or what allows us to do in practice, is super important.",
